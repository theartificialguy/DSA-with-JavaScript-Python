/*

=> STACK -> a data structure based on LIFO principle (last-in-first-out)
=> Operations -> push, pop, peek (top - last item in stack - if considering from end), isEmpty, size
=> Insertion (push) & Deletion (pop) happens from the SAME end (usually end)
	-> top - stack[stack.lenght-1]
=> Typical questions:
	1) reverse a string using stacks
	2) valid paranthesis
